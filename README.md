# reference_counting

Code samples from my talks on manual memory management in C and reference counting and smart pointers in C++

On Mac, you can compile and run the samples with the following commands:
For the c example:
clang /Users/cyrus0012/proj/garbage_collection/c_example/example.c -o hello; ./hello

For the c++ example:
clang++ ref_count.cpp -o ref_count; ./ref_count
